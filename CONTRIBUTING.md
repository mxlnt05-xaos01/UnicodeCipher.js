# Contributing Etiquette
Whenever you are contributing to the project, there are a couple of common etiquette you should know when you fork this repository and add your modifications in.
## Pull Requests
### ✅ Do
Be descriptive as much as you can while maintaining clarity in your pull request, this will help us understand why you are doing it.
### ❌ Don't
Put simple phrases like "Can I put in additional code?" in your pull request, we may not be able to understand your intention, and may get you denied from merging your changes into the project.
## Code Neatness
### ✅ Do
Put Comments talking about the processes and the obstacles you have faced and how you overcame them before the actual code, it helps me to know the processes and the challenges you've faced.
### ❌ Don't
Create spagetti code in any script file, this can make it harder to read for me and may cause logic or runtime errors in some programming languages.
## Security
### ✅ Do
Contribute and help someone with a website they have. In every case, security is my priority and I stand behind every single thing that can keep information secure.
### ❌ Don't
Deploy the code contents of this repository into a website that isn't secure or has suffered a data breach, you could actually be denied from merging your changes into the project or forking this repository (and I especially don't want that to happen!).
## Client-Side Functionality
### ✅ Do
Add Your HTML IDs into the HTMLElement field in ```document.getElementById()```, especially with input fields and forms, these have ```.addEventListener()``` attached to that method so it can allow the script to execute and output the desired result.
### ❌ Don't
Put random words/letters into the HTMLElement field, you do not want to deal with runtime errors while your website is running!
## Adding Your Own
### ✅ Do
Add helpful ideas in code, in a separate file if possible, and without interference with the main code. You may be able to bring new ideas into the project that we didn't think about!
### ❌ Don't
Put any idea in code, as not all ideas are helpful for me, if I see that the code that represents your idea can be detrimental to the security or compatibility of the project, you may need to rethink again. Too Bad!
## Node Modules
### ✅ Do
Put the modules that you need in one install command, this is proven to work and places every module into one folder, which can be more efficient and less error prone.
### ❌ Don't
Install npm Modules separately, this may confuse the coding program and can also cause potential problems, like outdated versions, and more...
## AI Code Suggestions
### ✅ Do
Learn from the AI Overview and take a look at the sources that the AI had cited in its summary, if there's nothing cited, you can scroll to see the search results if you are confused by what it is saying.
### ❌ Don't
Apply code from the AI Overview directly to the project, there's is something called "Vibe Coding" and it can potentially leave security out of the equation, which not only can be detrimental to my project integrity, but it could also pose a potential risk for security gaps (and can get you denied from merging your changes to the project).
## Server-Side Functionality
### ✅ Do
Use Middleware, like Express.js to manage requests from the client to the server, and can be used for many purposes, like sending the data to a database.
### ❌ Don't
Put certain information into the query, this may make your databases more vulnerable to injections.
